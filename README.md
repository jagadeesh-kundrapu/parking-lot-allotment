# Parking Lot Allotment

The provided code is a Python script for a personalized parking lot management system, designed and implemented by a team of three developers named Teja Swaroop, Jagdeesh Naidu, and Atharv Jaju. The code allows users to manage a parking lot by parking or removing cars and bikes while maintaining records of available and occupied parking spaces.

Key Features:

Parking Lot Initialization: The code starts by initializing the parking lot for cars and bikes. Users are prompted to enter the number of floors, columns, and rows for each vehicle type (cars and bikes).

Vehicle Parking and Exit: The code provides functionalities to park or remove cars and bikes from the parking lot. Users can enter vehicle numbers to park or remove their vehicles from the designated parking spots.

Validation and Error Handling: The code ensures that the entered vehicle numbers are valid and not duplicates. If there are any invalid or duplicate vehicle numbers, appropriate error messages are displayed, and the users are prompted to re-enter the correct details.

Comfortable Parking: The code aims to find the most comfortable parking spot for each vehicle, minimizing the chances of vehicles getting blocked by others.

Logging: The code keeps a record of parked vehicles and their corresponding parking spots, ensuring smooth and organized parking and retrieval of vehicles.

User-Friendly Interface: The code utilizes print statements to display relevant information and instructions, providing a user-friendly experience for parking lot management.
